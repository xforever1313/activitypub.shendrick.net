This clock lives on top of the [Kate Gleason Hall](https://www.rit.edu/housing/kate-gleason-hall) dormitory at Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY (also known as building 35).  This clock actually doesn't make any noise.  Instead, a bell tower with a speaker in it exists at the [Schmitt Interfaith Center](https://www.rit.edu/facilities/kilian-j-and-caroline-f-schmitt-interfaith-center) on campus, which is a short walk away.

Since the bell is still audible when the clock is in view, its good enough to make a bot!

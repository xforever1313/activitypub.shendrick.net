This clock tower is one of the landmarks at Hudson Valley Community College.  It is located in the quad between the Administration building (ADM), the Bulmer Telecommunications Center (BTC), the Marvin Library (MRV) and the Guenther Enrollment Services building (GUN) at the end of George E Halliday Drive.

It has four clock faces, and is green, one of the colors of HVCC.

This was the first bot that was created.  Also, the admin of this site is an alumni of HVCC.

Go Vikings!
